## 1.5 Strategies for Impressing Interviewers

With your technical skills sharpened and an impressive portfolio in hand, it's time to focus on strategies to impress interviewers. Let's break it down into two key areas: impressing the hiring manager and impressing the technical interviewers.

### 1.5.1 Impressing the Hiring Manager

When meeting with the hiring manager, your goal is to demonstrate your **fit for the role and the company**. Here are some tips to make a lasting impression:

- **Be consistent with your CV:** Ensure that the information you provide during the interview aligns with what's mentioned in your CV. _Be prepared to elaborate on your experiences and achievements_.
- **Demonstrate a desire to learn:** Show enthusiasm for _acquiring new skills and knowledge_. Discuss how you stay updated with the latest industry trends and technologies. **A good attitude overrules a pretense of expertise almost every time.**
- **Research the company and role:** Conduct thorough research on the company, its products, and the specific role you're applying for. Demonstrate your understanding of their mission, values, and how you can contribute to their goals.

Here's an example of how you can respond to a common question from a hiring manager:

> Question: I noticed that you don't have experience with [specific technology] mentioned in the job description. How do you plan to address this gap?

> Answer: While I haven't worked directly with [specific technology], I have experience with [related technology/concept]. I'm a quick learner and have a track record of successfully picking up new technologies on the job. I'm excited about the opportunity to expand my skill set and contribute to the team's success. I've already started exploring [specific technology] through online tutorials and documentation to gain a basic understanding.

### 1.5.2 Impressing the Technical Interviewers

Technical interviews are your chance to shine and showcase your problem-solving abilities. Here are some strategies to impress the technical interviewers:

- **Have a problem-solving strategy:** Approach coding questions with a structured and logical mindset. _Break down the problem into smaller subproblems, identify edge cases, and discuss your thought process out loud_.
- **Ask clarifying questions:** _Before diving into the solution, ask questions to clarify any ambiguities or assumptions_. This shows your attention to detail and ability to gather requirements.
- **Communicate your thought process:** As you code, _explain your approach, the trade-offs you're considering, and the reasoning behind your decisions_. This gives the interviewer insight into your problem-solving skills.
- **Justify your design choices:** Be prepared to discuss _why you chose a particular data structure, algorithm, or design pattern_. Explain the benefits and drawbacks of your approach (Remember big-O complexity? 🙂).

Here's an example of how you can tackle a coding question during a technical interview:

> Question: Implement a function that takes a string as input and returns true if it's a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), ignoring case and non-alphanumeric characters.

> Clarifying Questions:
>
> - Is an empty string considered a palindrome?
> - Should the function handle Unicode characters?
> - Is the input guaranteed to be a string, or should we handle other data types?

> Solution:
>
> ```python
> def is_palindrome(s):
>   # Convert the string to lowercase and remove non-alphanumeric characters
>   s = ''.join(c.lower() for c in s if c.isalnum())
>
>   # Compare the string with its reverse
>   return s == s[::-1]
> ```

> Explanation:
>
> - First, we convert the string to lowercase and remove all non-alphanumeric characters using a list comprehension and the isalnum() method.
> - Then, we compare the modified string with its reverse using slicing (s[::-1]).
> - If the modified string is equal to its reverse, it's a palindrome, and we return True. Otherwise, we return False.
>
> Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string.
> Space Complexity: O(n) to store the modified string.

By following these strategies and providing clear explanations, you demonstrate your technical prowess and leave a positive impression on the interviewers.

## 1.6 Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

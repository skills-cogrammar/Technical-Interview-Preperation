## Chapters

### [Chapter 1: Technical Interview Preparation Roadmap](chapter1-roadmap.md)

In this chapter, we provide a comprehensive roadmap to guide you through the technical interview preparation process. From understanding the interview landscape to developing a strong problem-solving mindset, this chapter lays the foundation for your journey. 🗺️

### [Chapter 2: Sequences](chapter2-sequences.md)

Sequences are a fundamental concept in programming and are frequently encountered in technical interviews. This chapter dives deep into the world of sequences, exploring various data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques. 🧩

### [Chapter 3: Divide and Conquer Algorithms](chapter3-divide-and-conquer.md)

Divide and Conquer is a powerful algorithmic paradigm that breaks down complex problems into smaller, more manageable subproblems. In this chapter, we explore the principles of Divide and Conquer and apply them to solve a range of problems efficiently. ⚔️

### [Chapter 4: Computational Complexity](chapter4-computational-complexity.md)

Understanding computational complexity is crucial for designing efficient algorithms and optimizing code performance. This chapter demystifies the concepts of time and space complexity, Big O notation, and provides techniques for analyzing and optimizing algorithms. 🔬

🚧 More chapters are currently in progress and will be added soon! Stay tuned for updates. 🚧
